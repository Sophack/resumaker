## Description

As Bootcamp Students, we wanted to create an app that allows users to create free resumes! Trying to get a job is one challenge but 
having to pay money just to create a resume is NOT COOL! This became our motivation for the project. We want to allow our users to 
create a FREE account and not have to enter any credit card details to use the application.
